## Best method followed
- Used functions to decrease dependency on main function
- Used loops to exicute the commands one bye one and follow the flow.
- Printf statements have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions
- Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty
